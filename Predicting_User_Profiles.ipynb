Currently living in New York City but leaning against settling down here permanently, and likes the idea of living somewhere family-friendly (that a suburb). By nerdy, I mean that I tend to get into phases where I get weirdly excited about things. To take a few random recent examples: Which countries have the best and most cost-effective transit systems, and urbanism and city planning more generally. Computability theory, or alternate computation models, like what its implications would look like for a world that had regular time travel. Acrobatics. The history of clothes making. Making homemade liquor. Building this took a surprisingly long time Cats. Elaborate improvised constructs. Also, glacier climbing What a world would look like if time travel was possible but constrained by computability limits, except that cats could effectively get around them by having weak preferences, and the whole thing ran on a hybrid Miyazaki/Moomins/FF7 aesthetic. And so on. By family-oriented, I mean, well I like happy families. And I like kids, and really want kids, and like the kind of family/tribal structures where people of different ages actually interact. I am slightly trad in some ways, by which I mean something like enjoying some traditions and traditional attitudes but not actually being particularly religious. So I like Friday night family dinners (with the candles and the nice tablecloth), and I like casual gender norms (In that, say, I prefer the sound of my wife my spouse), but do regular prayers or really keep kosher (except I eat pork). For stories I wrote this one about first contact, or this one about bike lanes. For song translations, I mostly do Israeli folk songs (like this one, or this one). Life/Relationship Goals Most of all, I want a family. I want a good happy partnership relationship, and I want a bunch of kids. probably practical constraints on how many kids I could practically have or handle, but in principle, a fan of the idea of having lots of kids. I think I would be a good dad. I currently live in New York and work doing vague finance and programming stuff. I like it here for now, but I want to settle down permanently, or raise kids here. Where I want to end up is a hard question  for having kids, want to be somewhere clean and pedestrian-friendly, where the kids can walk safely by themselves to get around or play outside or whatnot. Sometimes I think about going back to Israel, but there are other places that meet those conditions. (Financially, I do have more than enough to support a family, including if I was married to someone who wanted to be a homemaker or work nonprofit or whatever, or to take a few years off for that matter). My ideal relationship involves sharing random ideas that get us excited off each other, cooking or going on hikes together, randomly messaging each other cat pictures, developing a pool of shared references and frames that becomes a little like a shared language, spiderman kisses (that is, where one or both of the people doing the kissing are hanging upside-down), and eventually raising a bunch of kids together. Also, occasional backpacking trips where we wind up cooking improvised pancakes in random abandoned cabins. You? If the above part sounds appealing, you should try to contact me! You can email me find me on facebook, whatever. See? Very welcoming I like the idea of social proof   if we know people in common, you can talk to me through them, or talk to them about whether they think would work. Properties common in people I have good relationships with: Getting delighted by things. Probably the biggest single factor, although it can be hard to describe. If you’re the sort of person who would build the food pyramid I mentioned above, or give names to random wildlife, or stop to look in random windows because you’re curious what the people inside live like, or like to think about the logistics of feeding a continent of sentient hamsters, we are likely to get along and you should give me a call. Compatible life goals. This one is pretty obvious, I guess. Ability to resolve conflicts. I’m not always great at immediately noticing when something is bothering someone, but I do listen when people talk to me about things. It helps a lot in a relationship, if  someone who can bring up things that bother you, and we can talk it through and solve it. Having initiative, and dreams, and like to do things.They  have to be shared interests   I just like people who have interests they get excited about.Finally, if you do want to contact me but aren’t sure how, ideas for conversation starters. What would the world look like if it had time-travelling cats? If you had the choice to be turned into a group of hamsters, how many hamsters would it take for you to prefer being the group of hamsters to being human? What’s something you deeply care about, or something that would make your life or your neighborhood or the world better? If you could be in any sort of place imaginable right now, where would you be? Any random thing you’ve been thinking about lately Just ‘Hi’ is also good!']\n",
