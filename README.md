# Predicting-User-Profile

# Overview. 
# In this project, I predicted users’ gender based on profile essays on OkCupid dating app. Data preprocessing was conducted to prepare for data analysis, and gender predictions were made using naive bayes classifier. Words associated with male profile include ‘computer’, ‘software’, ‘fixing’, and words associated with female profile  include ‘love, ‘like’, ‘music.’ 

# Dataset. 
# The dataset was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles). The categorical part of the dataset (ex: religion, education level, etc.) was cleaned for exploratory data analysis, and the essay portion of the dataset (ie, self-introduction) was analyzed using natural language processing.
